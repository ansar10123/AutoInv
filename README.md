A robust AutoInventory plugin for PocketMine-MP, designed for high performance and absolute stability. Features include direct-to-inventory drops, full inventory detection, configurable messages, and fine-grained permission control. Its core design prevents item duplication bugs by using fail-safe logic: ground drops are cancelled before items are added to the inventory, guaranteeing that items can never be duplicated, even during server lag or crashes.

## 🎯 **The Vision**

We're developing **API-specific AI models** trained to excel at particular frameworks and libraries. Our first model focuses on **PocketMine plugin development**.

## 🔍 **The Problem We're Solving**

While general-purpose AI models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude are capable, they face limitations when working with specialized APIs:

```diff
- Training data often lags behind the latest API versions
- Lack deep, specialized knowledge of framework patterns
- General training = not optimized for specific ecosystems
+ Our solution: Framework-focused training for better results
```

## ⚡ **Our Approach**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🎯 **Specialized Training**
- Deep understanding of API conventions
- Framework-specific patterns & optimizations
- Current best practices integration

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🚀 **Better Results**
- Accurate code generation
- Reduced API hallucinations
- Context-aware implementations
